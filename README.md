**README for AI-Powered Application Generator**

This project utilizes the Gemini API and Python to generate a file structure and code for a user-defined application. The generated files are then zipped into a single archive.

**Prerequisites**

- Python 3.x
- Google Gemini API key (sign up at https://gemini.ai/)
- `google-generativeai` Python package (install with `pip install google-generativeai`)
- `zipfile` Python package (included in the standard library)

**Usage**

1. Replace the placeholder API key in the `genai.configure()` function with your own Gemini API key.
2. Run the script using Python: `python application_generator.py`
3. Follow the prompts to describe the application you want to build.
4. The script will generate a file structure and code based on your input.
5. The generated files will be saved in a directory named "output".
6. A zip file named "generated_application.zip" will be created containing all the generated files.

**File Structure**

The generated file structure will depend on the application description provided by the user. The script currently supports creating directories and files.

**Limitations**

- The AI model used for code generation is based on text-bison-001, which may not produce perfect code.
- The file limit is set to 20 files to prevent excessive file generation.
- The script does not handle errors or exceptions gracefully.

**Future Improvements**

- Implement error handling and logging for better debugging and user experience.
- Add support for more advanced code generation features, such as generating database schemas or integrating with external APIs.
- Improve the user interface by using a graphical interface or a command-line interface with better input validation and error messages.
- Add support for generating documentation or README files for the generated application.
- Explore using machine learning models to enhance code generation and improve the overall user experience.
